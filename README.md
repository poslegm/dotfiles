# .dotfiles
My configuration files for vim, zsh, tmux and git. Most of this I took from good people in the Internet.  
If you want to use it you need to edit `git/.gitconfig` necessarily.

### Installation
* `git clone https://github.com/poslegm/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`
* Read `make list-deps`
* Try `yaourt -S `cat ./flat-requirements.txt`` or same trick for your package manager
* `make download-deps`
* `make install`
* Fix bugs manually
* ???
* Profit!
